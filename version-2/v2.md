## part 1 

Scenario: You have been hired by a media company to develop an internal article management system. Journalists, editors, and administrators will use the system to create, edit, review, and publish articles. The system also includes an API to allow integration with third-party platforms.

You need to build the following features in the system:

Part 1: Article Submission Form
The first task is to create a two-page form that allows journalists to submit articles for review.

Form Fields:

Page 1:
Title (Text Field)
Subtitle (Text Field)
Article Content (Text Area)
Author Name (Text Field)
Email Address (Email Field)
Page 2:
Article Image (File Upload)
Tags (Checkboxes for predefined tags like Politics, Sports, Tech, etc.)
Category (Dropdown with categories like News, Opinion, Feature)
Publish Date (Date Field, must be a future date)
Agree to Terms (Checkbox)
Custom Validation:

Ensure the title is at least 10 characters long.
Validate that the publish date is in the future.
Email field must have a valid format.
Ensure that the terms checkbox is checked.
Pagination:

Implement pagination to split the form across two pages, with the ability to navigate between pages without losing form data.
Error Handling:

Display validation errors with user-friendly messages.
Part 2: Article Management System (Backend & API)
The second part involves building the backend for managing articles and users, including authentication, CRUD operations, and API integration.

Authentication:

Implement user registration, login, and logout functionality.
Use Django's built-in authentication system.
Allow users to reset passwords via email.
Authorization:

Three user roles:
Journalist: Can submit and edit their own articles but cannot publish them.
Editor: Can review, approve, and publish articles.
Admin: Has full access to create, edit, delete, and manage users.
Use Django’s permission system to restrict actions based on roles.
CRUD Operations:

Create a model called Article with fields such as title, content, author, image, tags, category, and publish_date.
Journalists can create and edit their own articles.
Editors can approve, reject, or publish articles.
Admins can manage articles and users.
Django Rest Framework (DRF) API:

Create an API for the Article model using DRF.
Implement CRUD operations via the API.
Use Token Authentication for the API.
Restrict API access based on user roles (e.g., only Editors and Admins can approve or publish articles).
Implement pagination, search, and filtering in the API (e.g., filter articles by category or search by title).

Implement email notifications when an article is submitted for review and when it is approved or rejected.
Create an endpoint for retrieving a list of published articles, accessible to the public.

## part 2 

Here is the additional task in the projects which the 2nd group of trainees need to do :

User Roles and Permissions:

Permissions: Add role-based permissions using Django's built-in permissions system for Journalist, Editor, and Admin.
Journalists can only submit and edit their own articles.
Editors can approve, reject, or publish articles.
Admins have full access to manage articles and users.
Implement these roles in the views and API to restrict access and actions based on the user role, similar to the PMS task.

JWT Authentication:

Implement JWT-based authentication instead of Django's default session-based authentication for the API, which allows secure authentication for API requests and enhances flexibility in external integrations (similar to the PMS bonus feature).

Views:

List View: Create a paginated list view of articles, with filtering options (by category, tags, and date).
Detail View: Implement a detailed view for each article, showing the full content, image, author details, and status.
Grid View: Display articles in a grid format (e.g., using 3 columns), for visual representation of articles.
Map View: If geographic location is relevant (e.g., articles tied to specific locations), integrate a map view that uses Google Maps or OpenStreetMap to show the locations of articles.

Image Gallery:

Add an image gallery functionality to articles, allowing multiple images to be uploaded for each article. This can be handled using a separate ArticleImage model and displaying the images as a gallery (similar to the PMS bonus feature).
Location-based Search:

If articles are linked to specific locations (e.g., articles covering news in particular cities or regions), implement location-based filtering. This could allow users to search for articles within a certain geographical area, using latitude and longitude coordinates stored in the Article model or via custom SQL queries.

Swagger API Documentation:

Integrate Swagger using drf-yasg to automatically generate API documentation. This will document all the API endpoints for CRUD operations, including the POST, GET, PUT/PATCH, and DELETE methods for articles and user management, similar to the PMS project.

Custom SQL Queries:

Implement raw SQL queries or use Django ORM to filter articles based on categories, tags, publish date, or author name. This could be used for the API's filtering, searching, or sorting features.
